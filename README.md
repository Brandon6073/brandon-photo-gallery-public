Photo Gallery using Django

This is a dynamic web-based photo gallery with a responsive web design. Photos can be uploaded without login. However, login as the admin is required to update or delete the photos. Django was used as a Python framework and connected to AWS to store the static files. The front-end was developed using only CSS3 and HTML5 without an additional framework.
